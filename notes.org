* Information Gathering
The goal of information gathering is to explore the attack surface that an organization presents to the world. An inexperienced attacker may penetrate the network at one point, but be stymied by isolation between different sections of the network. If she would have taken the time to explore the attack surface further, she could have found another entry point. Reconnaissance is all about enumeration.

** Non-technical
   I don't think that many online resources stress the value of this enough. General knowledge of the company you're pentesting will go a very long way, especially since so much of an attack surface is defined by /people/, who are by nature non-technical.

** Passive
*** Google advanced search techniques
    Often, misconfigured networks can leak data to aggressive web crawlers such as Google, and often that data can reveal vulnerabilities in the system.

    The [[https://www.exploit-db.com/google-hacking-database/][Google Hacking database]] is a valuable source of information on exploiting these misconfigurations. Use of "google hacking" can reveal connected webcams, password files, database backup files, intranet information, etc. These can be very useful in gaining a foothold on a network.

    A few examples from exploit-db:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE

#+END_QUOTE

I've focused mainly on the google dorks that involve getting a shell, as I think this is the most daunting first step for a budding pentester such as myself.
*** WHOIS enumeration
    This has come in useful on many occasions, not just for pentesting. A few months ago, I was going through my SSH logs and noticed that several machines were trying to brute-force the root password. So, I wrote a shell script to gather their IPs from my log. I don't quite recall, but I think it went something like this:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash :tangle locate-hackers.sh
  journalctl -u sshd | grep "login failed" > login.dat
  cat login.dat | cut -d " " -f 4 | sort -u > hackers_ordered.txt
#+END_SRC

 The list I got goes as follows:

#+END_SRC

I knew it was common for botnets to operate through the tor network, and that finding the culprit would not be plausible for tor-related traffic, so I filtered out the known tor exit nodes:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash :tangle filter-tor-hackers.sh
  grep -v -f known_tor_exit_nodes.txt hackers_ordered.txt \
       > hackers_not_on_tor.txt
#+END_SRC

From there, I went through each IP, and ran a WHOIS lookup on the addresses (tunnelled through tor to hide -- or at least partially mask -- my identity).

#+BEGIN_SRC bash :tangle harvest-hacker-ips.sh
  for ip in $(cat hackers_not_on_tor.txt)
  do
      echo "Performing whois lookup on $ip";
      whois $ip >> botnet_info.txt;
  done
#+END_SRC

The fruits of my labor were a list of companies that most directly controlled the addresses in question.

#+BEGIN_SRC bash :tangle botnet_info.txt

#+END_SRC

Whois enumeration is a very powerful tool.

** Active
Port scanning is a critical method for determining the services that run on a network. While port scans can be run via a handwritten script (in bash or python, for example), many programs are optimized to do port scans quickly and thoroughly. Perhaps the most widely used of these programs is Nmap.

*** Nmap
Nmap supports a variety of different scan types, and I found [[https://nmap.org/book/man-port-scanning-techniques.html][this article]] useful in understanding the differences between them.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
As a novice performing automotive repair, I can struggle for hours trying to fit my rudimentary tools (hammer, duct tape, wrench, etc.) to the task at hand. When I fail miserably and tow my jalopy to a real mechanic, he invariably fishes around in a huge tool chest until pulling out the perfect gizmo which makes the job seem effortless. The art of port scanning is similar. Experts understand the dozens of scan techniques and choose the appropriate one (or combination) for a given task. Inexperienced users and script kiddies, on the other hand, try to solve every problem with the default SYN scan. Since Nmap is free, the only barrier to port scanning mastery is knowledge. That certainly beats the automotive world, where it may take great skill to determine that you need a strut spring compressor, then you still have to pay thousands of dollars for it.

Most of the scan types are only available to privileged users. This is because they send and receive raw packets, which requires root access on Unix systems. Using an administrator account on Windows is recommended, though Nmap sometimes works for unprivileged users on that platform when WinPcap has already been loaded into the OS. Requiring root privileges was a serious limitation when Nmap was released in 1997, as many users only had access to shared shell accounts. Now, the world is different. Computers are cheaper, far more people have always-on direct Internet access, and desktop Unix systems (including Linux and Mac OS X) are prevalent. A Windows version of Nmap is now available, allowing it to run on even more desktops. For all these reasons, users have less need to run Nmap from limited shared shell accounts. This is fortunate, as the privileged options make Nmap far more powerful and flexible.

While Nmap attempts to produce accurate results, keep in mind that all of its insights are based on packets returned by the target machines (or firewalls in front of them). Such hosts may be untrustworthy and send responses intended to confuse or mislead Nmap. Much more common are non-RFC-compliant hosts that do not respond as they should to Nmap probes. FIN, NULL, and Xmas scans are particularly susceptible to this problem. Such issues are specific to certain scan types and so are discussed in the individual scan type entries.

This section documents the dozen or so port scan techniques supported by Nmap. Only one method may be used at a time, except that UDP scan (-sU) and any one of the SCTP scan types (-sY, -sZ) may be combined with any one of the TCP scan types. As a memory aid, port scan type options are of the form -s<C>, where <C> is a prominent character in the scan name, usually the first. The one exception to this is the deprecated FTP bounce scan (-b). By default, Nmap performs a SYN Scan, though it substitutes a connect scan if the user does not have proper privileges to send raw packets (requires root access on Unix). Of the scans listed in this section, unprivileged users can only execute connect and FTP bounce scans.

-sS (TCP SYN scan)
SYN scan is the default and most popular scan option for good reasons. It can be performed quickly, scanning thousands of ports per second on a fast network not hampered by restrictive firewalls. It is also relatively unobtrusive and stealthy since it never completes TCP connections. SYN scan works against any compliant TCP stack rather than depending on idiosyncrasies of specific platforms as Nmap's FIN/NULL/Xmas, Maimon and idle scans do. It also allows clear, reliable differentiation between the open, closed, and filtered states.

This technique is often referred to as half-open scanning, because you don't open a full TCP connection. You send a SYN packet, as if you are going to open a real connection and then wait for a response. A SYN/ACK indicates the port is listening (open), while a RST (reset) is indicative of a non-listener. If no response is received after several retransmissions, the port is marked as filtered. The port is also marked filtered if an ICMP unreachable error (type 3, code 0, 1, 2, 3, 9, 10, or 13) is received. The port is also considered open if a SYN packet (without the ACK flag) is received in response. This can be due to an extremely rare TCP feature known as a simultaneous open or split handshake connection (see https://nmap.org/misc/split-handshake.pdf).

-sT (TCP connect scan)
TCP connect scan is the default TCP scan type when SYN scan is not an option. This is the case when a user does not have raw packet privileges. Instead of writing raw packets as most other scan types do, Nmap asks the underlying operating system to establish a connection with the target machine and port by issuing the connect system call. This is the same high-level system call that web browsers, P2P clients, and most other network-enabled applications use to establish a connection. It is part of a programming interface known as the Berkeley Sockets API. Rather than read raw packet responses off the wire, Nmap uses this API to obtain status information on each connection attempt.

When SYN scan is available, it is usually a better choice. Nmap has less control over the high level connect call than with raw packets, making it less efficient. The system call completes connections to open target ports rather than performing the half-open reset that SYN scan does. Not only does this take longer and require more packets to obtain the same information, but target machines are more likely to log the connection. A decent IDS will catch either, but most machines have no such alarm system. Many services on your average Unix system will add a note to syslog, and sometimes a cryptic error message, when Nmap connects and then closes the connection without sending data. Truly pathetic services crash when this happens, though that is uncommon. An administrator who sees a bunch of connection attempts in her logs from a single system should know that she has been connect scanned.

-sU (UDP scans)
While most popular services on the Internet run over the TCP protocol, UDP services are widely deployed. DNS, SNMP, and DHCP (registered ports 53, 161/162, and 67/68) are three of the most common. Because UDP scanning is generally slower and more difficult than TCP, some security auditors ignore these ports. This is a mistake, as exploitable UDP services are quite common and attackers certainly don't ignore the whole protocol. Fortunately, Nmap can help inventory UDP ports.

UDP scan is activated with the -sU option. It can be combined with a TCP scan type such as SYN scan (-sS) to check both protocols during the same run.

UDP scan works by sending a UDP packet to every targeted port. For some common ports such as 53 and 161, a protocol-specific payload is sent to increase response rate, but for most ports the packet is empty unless the --data, --data-string, or --data-length options are specified. If an ICMP port unreachable error (type 3, code 3) is returned, the port is closed. Other ICMP unreachable errors (type 3, codes 0, 1, 2, 9, 10, or 13) mark the port as filtered. Occasionally, a service will respond with a UDP packet, proving that it is open. If no response is received after retransmissions, the port is classified as open|filtered. This means that the port could be open, or perhaps packet filters are blocking the communication. Version detection (-sV) can be used to help differentiate the truly open ports from the filtered ones.

A big challenge with UDP scanning is doing it quickly. Open and filtered ports rarely send any response, leaving Nmap to time out and then conduct retransmissions just in case the probe or response were lost. Closed ports are often an even bigger problem. They usually send back an ICMP port unreachable error. But unlike the RST packets sent by closed TCP ports in response to a SYN or connect scan, many hosts rate limit ICMP port unreachable messages by default. Linux and Solaris are particularly strict about this. For example, the Linux 2.4.20 kernel limits destination unreachable messages to one per second (in net/ipv4/icmp.c).

Nmap detects rate limiting and slows down accordingly to avoid flooding the network with useless packets that the target machine will drop. Unfortunately, a Linux-style limit of one packet per second makes a 65,536-port scan take more than 18 hours. Ideas for speeding your UDP scans up include scanning more hosts in parallel, doing a quick scan of just the popular ports first, scanning from behind the firewall, and using --host-timeout to skip slow hosts.

-sY (SCTP INIT scan)
SCTP is a relatively new alternative to the TCP and UDP protocols, combining most characteristics of TCP and UDP, and also adding new features like multi-homing and multi-streaming. It is mostly being used for SS7/SIGTRAN related services but has the potential to be used for other applications as well. SCTP INIT scan is the SCTP equivalent of a TCP SYN scan. It can be performed quickly, scanning thousands of ports per second on a fast network not hampered by restrictive firewalls. Like SYN scan, INIT scan is relatively unobtrusive and stealthy, since it never completes SCTP associations. It also allows clear, reliable differentiation between the open, closed, and filtered states.

This technique is often referred to as half-open scanning, because you don't open a full SCTP association. You send an INIT chunk, as if you are going to open a real association and then wait for a response. An INIT-ACK chunk indicates the port is listening (open), while an ABORT chunk is indicative of a non-listener. If no response is received after several retransmissions, the port is marked as filtered. The port is also marked filtered if an ICMP unreachable error (type 3, code 0, 1, 2, 3, 9, 10, or 13) is received.

-sN; -sF; -sX (TCP NULL, FIN, and Xmas scans)
These three scan types (even more are possible with the --scanflags option described in the next section) exploit a subtle loophole in the TCP RFC to differentiate between open and closed ports. Page 65 of RFC 793 says that “if the [destination] port state is CLOSED .... an incoming segment not containing a RST causes a RST to be sent in response.” Then the next page discusses packets sent to open ports without the SYN, RST, or ACK bits set, stating that: “you are unlikely to get here, but if you do, drop the segment, and return.”

When scanning systems compliant with this RFC text, any packet not containing SYN, RST, or ACK bits will result in a returned RST if the port is closed and no response at all if the port is open. As long as none of those three bits are included, any combination of the other three (FIN, PSH, and URG) are OK. Nmap exploits this with three scan types:

Null scan (-sN)
Does not set any bits (TCP flag header is 0)

FIN scan (-sF)
Sets just the TCP FIN bit.

Xmas scan (-sX)
Sets the FIN, PSH, and URG flags, lighting the packet up like a Christmas tree.

These three scan types are exactly the same in behavior except for the TCP flags set in probe packets. If a RST packet is received, the port is considered closed, while no response means it is open|filtered. The port is marked filtered if an ICMP unreachable error (type 3, code 0, 1, 2, 3, 9, 10, or 13) is received.

The key advantage to these scan types is that they can sneak through certain non-stateful firewalls and packet filtering routers. Another advantage is that these scan types are a little more stealthy than even a SYN scan. Don't count on this though—most modern IDS products can be configured to detect them. The big downside is that not all systems follow RFC 793 to the letter. A number of systems send RST responses to the probes regardless of whether the port is open or not. This causes all of the ports to be labeled closed. Major operating systems that do this are Microsoft Windows, many Cisco devices, BSDI, and IBM OS/400. This scan does work against most Unix-based systems though. Another downside of these scans is that they can't distinguish open ports from certain filtered ones, leaving you with the response open|filtered.

-sA (TCP ACK scan)
This scan is different than the others discussed so far in that it never determines open (or even open|filtered) ports. It is used to map out firewall rulesets, determining whether they are stateful or not and which ports are filtered.

The ACK scan probe packet has only the ACK flag set (unless you use --scanflags). When scanning unfiltered systems, open and closed ports will both return a RST packet. Nmap then labels them as unfiltered, meaning that they are reachable by the ACK packet, but whether they are open or closed is undetermined. Ports that don't respond, or send certain ICMP error messages back (type 3, code 0, 1, 2, 3, 9, 10, or 13), are labeled filtered.

-sW (TCP Window scan)
Window scan is exactly the same as ACK scan except that it exploits an implementation detail of certain systems to differentiate open ports from closed ones, rather than always printing unfiltered when a RST is returned. It does this by examining the TCP Window field of the RST packets returned. On some systems, open ports use a positive window size (even for RST packets) while closed ones have a zero window. So instead of always listing a port as unfiltered when it receives a RST back, Window scan lists the port as open or closed if the TCP Window value in that reset is positive or zero, respectively.

This scan relies on an implementation detail of a minority of systems out on the Internet, so you can't always trust it. Systems that don't support it will usually return all ports closed. Of course, it is possible that the machine really has no open ports. If most scanned ports are closed but a few common port numbers (such as 22, 25, 53) are filtered, the system is most likely susceptible. Occasionally, systems will even show the exact opposite behavior. If your scan shows 1,000 open ports and three closed or filtered ports, then those three may very well be the truly open ones.

-sM (TCP Maimon scan)
The Maimon scan is named after its discoverer, Uriel Maimon. He described the technique in Phrack Magazine issue #49 (November 1996). Nmap, which included this technique, was released two issues later. This technique is exactly the same as NULL, FIN, and Xmas scans, except that the probe is FIN/ACK. According to RFC 793 (TCP), a RST packet should be generated in response to such a probe whether the port is open or closed. However, Uriel noticed that many BSD-derived systems simply drop the packet if the port is open.

--scanflags (Custom TCP scan)
Truly advanced Nmap users need not limit themselves to the canned scan types offered. The --scanflags option allows you to design your own scan by specifying arbitrary TCP flags. Let your creative juices flow, while evading intrusion detection systems whose vendors simply paged through the Nmap man page adding specific rules!

The --scanflags argument can be a numerical flag value such as 9 (PSH and FIN), but using symbolic names is easier. Just mash together any combination of URG, ACK, PSH, RST, SYN, and FIN. For example, --scanflags URGACKPSHRSTSYNFIN sets everything, though it's not very useful for scanning. The order these are specified in is irrelevant.

In addition to specifying the desired flags, you can specify a TCP scan type (such as -sA or -sF). That base type tells Nmap how to interpret responses. For example, a SYN scan considers no-response to indicate a filtered port, while a FIN scan treats the same as open|filtered. Nmap will behave the same way it does for the base scan type, except that it will use the TCP flags you specify instead. If you don't specify a base type, SYN scan is used.

-sZ (SCTP COOKIE ECHO scan)
SCTP COOKIE ECHO scan is a more advanced SCTP scan. It takes advantage of the fact that SCTP implementations should silently drop packets containing COOKIE ECHO chunks on open ports, but send an ABORT if the port is closed. The advantage of this scan type is that it is not as obvious a port scan than an INIT scan. Also, there may be non-stateful firewall rulesets blocking INIT chunks, but not COOKIE ECHO chunks. Don't be fooled into thinking that this will make a port scan invisible; a good IDS will be able to detect SCTP COOKIE ECHO scans too. The downside is that SCTP COOKIE ECHO scans cannot differentiate between open and filtered ports, leaving you with the state open|filtered in both cases.

-sI <zombie host>[:<probeport>] (idle scan)
This advanced scan method allows for a truly blind TCP port scan of the target (meaning no packets are sent to the target from your real IP address). Instead, a unique side-channel attack exploits predictable IP fragmentation ID sequence generation on the zombie host to glean information about the open ports on the target. IDS systems will display the scan as coming from the zombie machine you specify (which must be up and meet certain criteria). Full details of this fascinating scan type are in the section called “TCP Idle Scan (-sI)”.

Besides being extraordinarily stealthy (due to its blind nature), this scan type permits mapping out IP-based trust relationships between machines. The port listing shows open ports from the perspective of the zombie host. So you can try scanning a target using various zombies that you think might be trusted (via router/packet filter rules).

You can add a colon followed by a port number to the zombie host if you wish to probe a particular port on the zombie for IP ID changes. Otherwise Nmap will use the port it uses by default for TCP pings (80).

-sO (IP protocol scan)
IP protocol scan allows you to determine which IP protocols (TCP, ICMP, IGMP, etc.) are supported by target machines. This isn't technically a port scan, since it cycles through IP protocol numbers rather than TCP or UDP port numbers. Yet it still uses the -p option to select scanned protocol numbers, reports its results within the normal port table format, and even uses the same underlying scan engine as the true port scanning methods. So it is close enough to a port scan that it belongs here.

Besides being useful in its own right, protocol scan demonstrates the power of open-source software. While the fundamental idea is pretty simple, I had not thought to add it nor received any requests for such functionality. Then in the summer of 2000, Gerhard Rieger conceived the idea, wrote an excellent patch implementing it, and sent it to the announce mailing list (then called nmap-hackers). I incorporated that patch into the Nmap tree and released a new version the next day. Few pieces of commercial software have users enthusiastic enough to design and contribute their own improvements!

Protocol scan works in a similar fashion to UDP scan. Instead of iterating through the port number field of a UDP packet, it sends IP packet headers and iterates through the eight-bit IP protocol field. The headers are usually empty, containing no data and not even the proper header for the claimed protocol. The exceptions are TCP, UDP, ICMP, SCTP, and IGMP. A proper protocol header for those is included since some systems won't send them otherwise and because Nmap already has functions to create them. Instead of watching for ICMP port unreachable messages, protocol scan is on the lookout for ICMP protocol unreachable messages. If Nmap receives any response in any protocol from the target host, Nmap marks that protocol as open. An ICMP protocol unreachable error (type 3, code 2) causes the protocol to be marked as closed while port unreachable (type 3, code 3) marks the protocol open. Other ICMP unreachable errors (type 3, code 0, 1, 9, 10, or 13) cause the protocol to be marked filtered (though they prove that ICMP is open at the same time). If no response is received after retransmissions, the protocol is marked open|filtered

*** Unicornscan
I think Unicornscan is worth mentioning because it implements its own IP stack using asynchcronous, non-blocking methods, which allow port scans to be performed much more quickly. 

*** DNS
I have less hands on experience with DNS, but I know more of the theory behind it, having read the RFCs associated with the protocols. 

I know, for example, that if several IPs are found within a specific range, an iterative loop can be used to discover more private (or at least previously undisclosed) addresses belonging to the target organization. 

I could use such a lookup, for example, on the IP ranges I found in botnet_info.txt. This escalation from passive to active, I realized was probably not justifiable given the circumstances, so I did not use a brute-force reverse DNS lookup.

* Vulnerability Scanning
I need more experience with vulnerability scanning. Most of the tools recommended by the Kali manuals such as OpenVas and Nessus gave me weird errors during the setup process. I'd like a chance to properly configure one.

* Buffer Overflow
This is one of the coolest units of this study program that I've done. It's fascinating to explore the interplay between programs and data. I'm considering learning a language like lisp, which blurs the line even further.

I think [[https:www.geeksforgeeks.org/buffer-overflow-attack-with-example/][this article]] was really helpful in understanding the basic principles.

The article gives an example of a vulnerable c program:

#+BEGIN_SRC c :tangle buff_vuln.c
  // A C program to demonstrate buffer overflow
  #include <stdio.h>
  #include <string.h>
  #include <stdlib.h>
 
  int main(int argc, char *argv[])
  {

         // Reserve 5 byte of buffer plus the terminating NULL.
         // should allocate 8 bytes = 2 double words,
         // To overflow, need more than 8 bytes...
         char buffer[5];  // If more than 8 characters input
                          // by user, there will be access
                          // violation, segmentation fault

         // a prompt how to execute the program...
         if (argc < 2)
         {
                printf("strcpy() NOT executed....\n");
                printf("Syntax: %s <characters>\n", argv[0]);
                exit(0);
         }

         // copy the user input to mybuffer, without any
         // bound checking a secure version is srtcpy_s()
         strcpy(buffer, argv[1]);
         printf("buffer content= %s\n", buffer);

         // you may want to try strcpy_s()
         printf("strcpy() executed...\n");

         return 0;
  }
#+END_SRC

When the buffer is overwritten, the execution flow is altered in unintended ways, leading in this case to a segmentation fault. In other cases, the outcome could be much worse.

We can test for a buffer overflow using a Fuzzer, which sends bad inputs to a program to test for unexpected outputs.

The Offensive Security Documentation gives us a use-case for such a fuzzer:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
During a host reconnaissance session we discovered an IMAP Mail server which is known to be vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack (Surgemail 3.8k4-4). We found an advisory for the vulnerability but can’t find any working exploits in the Metasploit database nor on the internet. We then decide to write our own exploit starting with a simple IMAP fuzzer.

From the advisory we do know that the vulnerable command is IMAP LIST and you need valid credentials to exploit the application. As we’ve previously seen, the big “library arsenal” present in MSF can help us to quickly script any network protocol and the IMAP protocol is not an exception. Including Msf::Exploit::Remote::Imap will save us a lot of time. In fact, connecting to the IMAP server and performing the authentication steps required to fuzz the vulnerable command, is just a matter of a single line command line! Here is the code for the IMAP LIST fuzzer:

      end

#+END_SRC
This code allows us to verify that a buffer overflow exploit has been successful, and give us some idea of the length of our buffer. But by using a debugger, we can get an idea of the exact bytes where our payload will have to land in order to control the return address.
** Android buffer overflow bug I found
Quite by accident, as I was studying this, I stumbled across what I suspect to be a bug/vulnerability in the Android OS. The WiFi dialog accepts both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses, but allocates a buffer large enough for only an IPv4 address. When given an IPv6 address, the system crashes. My worry was that this behavior could be induced by sharing a malformed WiFi profile, but I haven't been able to replicate it yet.

* Password Attacks
** John the Ripper
   The villain that plagues /every/ *single* cyberpatriot competition. Not an image has gone by without John the ripper being loaded onto it. This is an algorithm that can run on a compromised computer that tries to guess a password given its hash. 

   From the [[http://www.openwall.com/john/doc/][Documentation]]:
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
To run John, you need to supply it with some password files and optionally specify a cracking mode, like this, using the default order of modes and assuming that "passwd" is a copy of your password file:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
	john passwd
#+END_SRC
or, to restrict it to the wordlist mode only, but permitting the use of word mangling rules:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
	john --wordlist=password.lst --rules passwd
#+END_SRC
Cracked passwords will be printed to the terminal and saved in the file called $JOHN/john.pot (in the documentation and in the configuration file for John, "$JOHN" refers to John's "home directory"; which directory it really is depends on how you installed John). The $JOHN/john.pot file is also used to not load password hashes that you already cracked when you run John the next time.

To retrieve the cracked passwords, run:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
	john --show passwd
#+END_SRC
While cracking, you can press any key for status, or 'q' or Ctrl-C to abort the session saving its state to a file ($JOHN/john.rec by default). If you press Ctrl-C for a second time before John had a chance to complete handling of your first Ctrl-C, John will abort immediately without saving. By default, the state is also saved every 10 minutes to permit for recovery in case of a crash.

To continue an interrupted session, run:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
	john --restore
#+END_SRC
These are just the most essential things you can do with John. For a complete list of command line options and for more complicated usage examples you should refer to OPTIONS and EXAMPLES, respectively.

Please note that "binary" (pre-compiled) distributions of John may include alternate executables instead of just "john". You may need to choose the executable that fits your system best, e.g. "john-omp" to take advantage of multiple CPUs and/or CPU cores.

Features and performance.

John the Ripper is designed to be both feature-rich and fast. It combines several cracking modes in one program and is fully configurable for your particular needs (you can even define a custom cracking mode using the built-in compiler supporting a subset of C). Also, John is available for several different platforms which enables you to use the same cracker everywhere (you can even continue a cracking session which you started on another platform).

Out of the box, John supports (and autodetects) the following Unix crypt(3) hash types: traditional DES-based, "bigcrypt", BSDI extended DES-based, FreeBSD MD5-based (also used on Linux and in Cisco IOS), and OpenBSD Blowfish-based (now also used on some Linux distributions and supported by recent versions of Solaris). Also supported out of the box are Kerberos/AFS and Windows LM (DES-based) hashes, as well as DES-based tripcodes.

When running on Linux distributions with glibc 2.7+, John 1.7.6+ additionally supports (and autodetects) SHA-crypt hashes (which are actually used by recent versions of Fedora and Ubuntu), with optional OpenMP parallelization (requires GCC 4.2+, needs to be explicitly enabled at compile-time by uncommenting the proper OMPFLAGS line near the beginning of the Makefile).

Similarly, when running on recent versions of Solaris, John 1.7.6+ supports and autodetects SHA-crypt and SunMD5 hashes, also with optional OpenMP parallelization (requires GCC 4.2+ or recent Sun Studio, needs to be explicitly enabled at compile-time by uncommenting the proper OMPFLAGS line near the beginning of the Makefile and at runtime by setting the OMP_NUM_THREADS environment variable to the desired number of threads).

John the Ripper Pro adds support for Windows NTLM (MD4-based) and Mac OS X 10.4+ salted SHA-1 hashes.

"Community enhanced" -jumbo versions add support for many more password hash types, including Windows NTLM (MD4-based), Mac OS X 10.4-10.6 salted SHA-1 hashes, Mac OS X 10.7 salted SHA-512 hashes, raw MD5 and SHA-1, arbitrary MD5-based "web application" password hash types, hashes used by SQL database servers (MySQL, MS SQL, Oracle) and by some LDAP servers, several hash types used on OpenVMS, password hashes of the Eggdrop IRC bot, and lots of other hash types, as well as many non-hashes such as OpenSSH private keys, S/Key skeykeys files, Kerberos TGTs, PDF files, ZIP (classic PKZIP and WinZip/AES) and RAR archives.

Unlike older crackers, John normally does not use a crypt(3)-style routine. Instead, it has its own highly optimized modules for different hash types and processor architectures. Some of the algorithms used, such as bitslice DES, couldn't have been implemented within the crypt(3) API; they require a more powerful interface such as the one used in John. Additionally, there are assembly language routines for several processor architectures, most importantly for x86-64 and x86 with SSE2.
